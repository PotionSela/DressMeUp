# DressMeUp
Welcome to a new way of looking at your wardrobe! Here at DressMeUp we want to have our users to have fun with their closet again. This app can randomize an outfit for each user as many times as you want. You can go further and customize those randomized outfits, or either make a new outfit from scratch by going through each category!

# Description
This project is all about what you want from your own closet. Using the randomize function makes it easier for our users to create a new look that they might have not thought of. Going further, each user can customize their randomized looks to make an even more tailored look. The user can even like an outfit that either the app chose or they chose, and you can look through your likes to see exactly what it was! This app takes the exhaustion of picking out an outfit before you need to leave, no longer will you need to try on each clothing item, now you can sort through images of your own wardrobe.
